# Medical-Insurance-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model-
This is a machine learning model.
Hi there,
I'm a beginner and this is my first machine learning project. In this repository, I built a machine learning model for a medical insurance prediction.
This model is built based on the classification model under Supervised Machine Learning because the model is trying to predict if a customer will buy a type of medical insurance or not (check code to understand better).
Prerequisites to understand this project include;
Basic knowledge of Python
An understanding of data science
The whole process is broken down into 3 stages;
-Data Collection: here is the link to the dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmJA2zbp_GRhiXO8JWI0j1x30KN9WPdz/view?
-Data Preprocessing: using Numpy(for numerical operations), Panda(for data analysis), Seaborn(for data visualization and exploratory data analysis), and Matplotlib.pyplot ( for data visualization and graphical plotting).
-Model Building: I built using a logistic regression model, after which I fine- tune it using some hyperparameters.
I'm open to review/feedback on this project.
Thank you!
